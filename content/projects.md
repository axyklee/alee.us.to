## [Attendance System](https://github.com/axyklee/Attendance)
{{< carousel "/static/img/projects.md/attendance" >}}
I made our school's shiny new online attendance system with the help of my homeroom teacher to replace the old paper-based system. It was used for about half a semester stably but was later dropped because the school's IT department decided the services this utilized was not suitable to our school's infrastructure. It is now [open-sourced here](https://github.com/axyklee/Attendance). I also created a much more robust [version 2](https://github.com/axyklee/Attendance/tree/v2) with MySQL, but was never presented.

## [minigames](https://apcs.pages.dev)

A NextJS site with two mini-games I made for my APCSA Final Project. I made two games, TaiGuessr and TicTacToe. TaiGuessr is a geography game based on GeoGuessr I made from scratch. Built using [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/).

## FRC [2024-RobotCode](https://github.com/savagetumaz6947/2024-RobotCode)

This is the code repository for Parasaur, the FRC robot developed by Team 6947 Savage Tumaz for the 2023-2024 CRESCENDO Season. Parasaur competed in both the [Sacramento](https://www.thebluealliance.com/event/2024cada) (Rank 9, Alliance 4 First Pick) and [Central Valley](https://www.thebluealliance.com/event/2024cafr) (Rank 8, Alliance 4 First Pick) Regionals. We were honored to receive the Autonomous Award at the Sacramento Regional, and our team captain and lead programmer, Aaron Lee (me !!), was named a Dean's List Award Finalist at the Central Valley Regional.

> In the crucible of competition, where the line between the autonomous period and teleop becomes a frontier for innovation, one team stands out by extending autonomous brilliance into the realm of teleoperation. Utilizing a sophisticated vision system, it not only localizes to its surroundings but hunts down Notes with the precision of a savage predator. Through the clever application of A-star and D-star algorithms, it seamlessly navigates the terrain plotting direct courses to the goals set by the drivers. - Central Valley Regional

## FRC [Savage Tracking](https://github.com/axyklee/savage-tracking)

Time tracking app for FRC build season personnel management.

Developed by Aaron (me), and used by my FRC Team 6947 Savage Tumaz throughout the 2023-2024 CRESCENDO season, this application serves a dual purpose. Firstly, it logs the hours dedicated by team members during the intensive build season. These hours are a factor in determining eligibility for participation in regional events for our team. Additionally, the application maintains an up-to-date roster, essential for compliance with our school's stringent access control policies.
